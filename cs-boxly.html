			<h2>CASE STUDY</h2>
			<h1>BOXLY</h1>
			</div>
			<div class="summary"> 
			<h2>SUMMARY</h2>
			<p>Boxly is a SaaS (Software as a Service) web application which allows people to collect information, store it in a single place, and collaborate with others. A person can create simple documents, store images, links to websites, and collaborate with others. <br>
			<br>Boxly aims to provide a product that solves some of the pain points suffered by users of Dropbox, Google Docs, Evernote, and Pinterest, especially the pain point of easy, intuitive, and effective collaboration among team members. Basically, to provide a product that effectively merges the collaborative features of Google Docs with the storyboard layout of Pinterest and also the tagging/organizational/scanning capability of Evernote (e.g. scanning an image of a receipt and convert it into text, tagging notes into labels/folders for quick retrieval). </p>

			<h3>PROBLEM &amp; SOLUTION</h3>
			<p>The problem was that we needed to know what features to put in Boxly and how to position it in the market so that it stands out and provides a unique service that the market is currently lacking. We wanted to discover what features were neccessary in our app at the MVP level. We also wanted to discover what features were the most relevant to each different demographic, and which specific demographic we wonted to concentrate our efforts and resources on. <br>
			<br>
			It was important to research our users and discover the kinds of features that succeeded with people and what features (or lack of features) created pain points in the average user and to what degree these pain points influenced the users’ likelihood to continue or discontinue using the product. We were also interested in discovering to what extent the product’s UI and layout affected a user’s experience of the product and what degree of inconvenience a user was willing to put up with before leaving the product. We were also interested in determining the target market demographic we would be aiming for in developing Boxly. <br>
			<br>
			*** WRITE OUT SOLUTION *** Present and discuss your solutions (regarding features, layout, target market). </p>

			<h2>USER RESEARCH</h2>
			<p>We divided our Google form into the following sections: general questions regarding users’ electronic tools and online habits, how they save content, write notes, the types of interactions they had in their work environment, to what extent they used social media to sign onto other websites, and demographic/background info to better understand who are users are. <br>
			<br>
			Based on the responses we received, we were able to determine the following:</p><br>
			<ul>
				<li>Devices and browsing  All own a smart phone, tablet and laptop. More than half browse on their smart phones, while the majority use their laptop. Social networks were the most popular sites consumed.  Based on this information, we'll create a responsive experience so our users can access and view content in Blocbox from any device. </li>
				<li>Saving content  More than half save content some of the time, and typically bookmark items in the browser.  However, managing bookmarks is a common problem, as it can become cumbersome. Grouping content will be a focus as we design Blocbox.</li>
				<li>Competitors A potential competitor was mentioned, named Box. It is a multi-platform collaboration tool, but provides many of the features planned for Blocbox.  Competitive analysis helps determine how Blocbox is different than Box and how we can solve similar usability issues.</li>
				<li>Writing notes  All of our potential users write notes, both for personal and business. Smart phone apps and Evernote seem to be the most popular way of capturing these notes.  Simplicity in creating notes is recommended. Users want the process to be quick and accessible, much like using pen and paper.</li>
				<li>Work environment  Most of our responses came from designers and other tech positions, who work in a collaborative environment. Most share resources with their peers.  Being able to collaborate with ease will be required, and sharing needs to be simple. </li>
				<li>Social  All have either a Facebook or a Twitter account. Only one respondent said they don't use a social account to register on other sites.  A requirement for Blocbox is to include social registration. We can determine that this feature will be used by most users.  </li>
				<li>Demographic data  Our respondents are between 25-44 years old, and live all over the country. This information will help us in creating our user personas in the next checkpoint.</li>		  
			</ul>
			</div>
			<div class="analysis">
				<h3>COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS</h3>
				<p>In exploring other competitive web applications, we discovered certain brands, such as Box, Dropbox, Google Drive, Evernote, and Pinterest, were mentioned quite frequently. <br>
				<br>
				We also learned what they're doing right and wrong, and what features users enjoyed and didn’t enjoy.  Some questions we asked ourselves were:</p><br>
				<br>
				<ul>
					<li>How do they position themselves?</li>
				<li>Who is their primary audience?</li>
				<li>What user groups are they targeting?</li>
				<li>What are their key differentiators and features?</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
			<div class="personas">
				<h3>PERSONAS</h3>
				<p> Once we had compiled all the data we collected, we created three personas to represent the most common type of users we came across.</p>

						<h4>DANIEL JOHNSON</h4>
						<p> <strong>AGE:</strong> 26 <br>
							<strong>OCCUPATION:</strong> Design Director<br>
							<strong>LOCATION:</strong> Chicago, IL</p>
						<br>
						<q>If I had a way to share inspiration with my team, we could save time from meeting constantly.</q><br>
						<br>
						<p><strong>BIO</strong><br>
							Daniel is a young, single working professional in a big city. He’s worked at a number of startups in Chicago, and is now leading a team of 4 designers. He’s an early adopter, grabbing up the latest technology devices. He commutes into the city by subway, browsing on his phone during the 30minute ride. He’s interested in photography. He loves trying a new restaurant every night if possible. <br>
							<br>
							<strong>MOTIVATIONS</strong><br>
							Daniel loves to save images he finds online for inspiration. He’s bookmarked hundreds over the course of 3 years. However, the browser can just be slightly frustrating. Creating folders, managing them, etc. It’s sometimes overwhelming and should be easier. He wants to collaborate with others on his team to share what he finds with ease. Subscribes to several software applications, and never can remember passwords. Would love something that combines a few of those. <br>
							<br>
							<strong>FRUSTRATIONS</strong> <br>
							Difficulty managing bookmarks • Too many different softwares • Not accessible on all devices</p>

						<h4>SUSAN SENNICK</h4>
						<p><strong>AGE:</strong> 33 <br>
							<strong>OCCUPATION:</strong> Marketing Manager<br>
							<strong>LOCATION:</strong> Seattle, WA</p>
						<br>
						<q>I can never remember what I bookmarked, so having an easy way to view the stuff I like would be fantastic.</q><br>
						<br>
						<p><strong>BIO</strong><br>
							Susan is married with two kids, residing in the suburbs of Seattle. She is the marketing manager for a midsize company. When she leaves work, Susan doesn’t take her laptop home with her, trying to distinguish the boundary between home and work. However, she oftens finds herself working at night to finish projects. Susan’s an outdoors person, working her way across the Northwest. She loves camping while reading good books.<br>
							<br>
							<strong>MOTIVATIONS</strong><br>
							Susan typically bookmarks content she finds interesting in the browser. However, she often forgets what she’s bookmarked, and keeping track of it can be slightly overwhelming. She primarily uses her laptop at work to gather this type of content, but without it being synced online, she’s unable to access it at home. Susan likes to keep notes for herself and for work, but hasn’t found a tool she enjoys. While she works closely with peers, she rarely shares resources with them.<br>
							<br>
							<strong>FRUSTRATIONS</strong><br>
							Only accessible on work laptop • Hard to remember what’s bookmarked • Other software is difficult to use</p>

						<h4>AMY WINSOME</h4>
						<p><strong>AGE:</strong> 32 <br>
							<strong>OCCUPATION:</strong> Web Designer<br>
							<strong>LOCATION:</strong> Katy, TX</p>
						<br>
						<q>Right now, my computer can’t take all of the images I’m trying to save. I need a simple way to capture and refer back to this stuff.</q><br>
						<br>
						<p><strong>BIO</strong><br>
							Amy just recently became a web designer. She’s picked up a few freelance jobs and is interviewing with several companies for a fulltime position. She uses her phone to check Facebook and Twitter, and sometimes likes to jot down notes to remind her of things she needs to do. When she’s not chasing her toddler around the house, Amy loves to hit the beach, just an hour south of her. Swimming, running, and eating are her passions.<br>
							<br>
							<strong>MOTIVATIONS</strong><br>
							Amy is new to the world of design, and is currently gathering everything possible to help her. Typically, she downloads an image or takes a screenshot, and then she stores these on her computer. She’s used Pinterest before, but not for work. She likes being able to pull up the site anywhere, but organizing the content isn’t the easiest. For notes, she defers to pen and paper. It helps her remember things, but Amy often forgets to take the note pad with her when she leaves the house.<br>
							<br>
							<strong>FRUSTRATIONS</strong><br>
							Older computer has less hard drive space • Doesn’t know what tools to use • Organizing is time consuming</p>

				<h3>INFORMATION ARCHITECTURE</h3>
        <p>In a collaborative process using a whiteboard and sticky notes, we were able to map out and create <a href="#" target="_blank">user stories</a> and <a href="#">user flows</a> that helped us build a framework that informed the design of our wireframes and mockups. 
				<br>
				<br>
				As we <a href="">uncovered the users' needs in greater detail</a>, the user experience and layout of features began to take more shape and form, as old questions were answered and new questions came up. 
				<br>
				<br>
				For example, where should the card decks go? Where should the avatars be placed? How large or small should we make the profile image? How would player’s differentiate between the judge’s deck or the player’s deck of cards? How would players keep track of the score? How would we prompt the player when it’s his turn to be the judge? 
				<br>
				<br>
				Once we had fleshed out our sketches, we used Balsamiq to create wireframes based on the ideas that aligned the closest with the stakeholders' goals.</p>
