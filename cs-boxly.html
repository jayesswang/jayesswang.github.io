				<h3>ABOUT THIS PROJECT</h3>
				<br>
				<p><b>PROBLEM:</b> Users find it difficult to collect, store, and share information all in one place.<br>
					<br>
					<b>SOLUTION:</b> Curate the best features of competitors and combine them into one product. <br>
					<br>
					<b>RESULT:</b> Users enjoyed the simplicity and capability of the MVP to organize &amp; manage their information and suggested features for future releases. <br>
					<br>
					<b>MY ROLE:</b> Visual Design, Info Arch (e.g. user flows, wireframes), Usability Testing. <br>
					<br>
					<b>MY TOOLS:</b> Sketch, InVision, Figma, UserTesting.com, G-Suite (Forms, Sheet), Axure, Balsamiq.<br>

				<h3>SUMMARY</h3>
				<p>Boxly is a SaaS (Software as a Service) web application which allows people to collect information, store it in a single place, and collaborate with others. A person can create simple documents, store images, links to websites, and collaborate with others. <br>
				<br>
				We needed to know what features to put in Boxly and how to position it in the market so that it stands out and provides a unique service that the market is currently lacking. We wanted to discover what features were neccessary in our app at the MVP level. We also wanted to discover what features were the most relevant to each different demographic, and on which specific demographic to focus our efforts and resources. <br>
					<br>
					It was important to research our users and discover the kinds of features that succeeded with people and what features (or lack of features) created pain points in the average user and to what degree these pain points influenced the users’ likelihood to continue or discontinue using the product. We were also interested in discovering to what extent the product’s UI and layout affected a user’s experience of the product and what degree of inconvenience a user was willing to put up with before leaving the product. We were also interested in determining the target market demographic we would be aiming for in developing Boxly. <br>
					<br>

			<h3>USER RESEARCH</h3>
				<p>We divided our <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yEjeLfllGtONCwnbjeMkKtFn2mnHLRbgi0OHj3KQPGk/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">survey</a> into the following sections: </p><br>
				<ol>
					<li>General questions regarding users’ electronic tools and online habits</li>
					<li>How they save content and write notes</li>
					<li>The types of interactions they had in their work environment</li>
					<li>To what extent they used social media to sign onto other websites</li>
					<li>Demographic/background info to better understand who are users are</li>

					<p>Boxly aims to provide a product that solves some of the pain points suffered by users of Dropbox, Google Docs, Evernote, and Pinterest, especially when it comes to easy, intuitive, and effective collaboration among team members. We strove to create a product that effectively merges the collaborative features of Google Docs with the aesthetics of Dropbox Paper, the storyboard layout of Pinterest, and the organizational capability of Evernote (e.g. scanning an image of a receipt and converting it into text, tagging notes and articles into labels/folders for quick retrieval). </p>

					<h4>DANIEL JOHNSON</h4>
					<p> <strong>AGE:</strong> 26 <br>
						<strong>OCCUPATION:</strong> Design Director<br>
						<strong>LOCATION:</strong> Chicago, IL</p>
					<br>
					<q>If I had a way to share inspiration with my team, we could save time from meeting constantly.</q><br>
					<br>
					<p><strong>BIO</strong><br>
						Daniel is a young, single working professional in a big city. He’s worked at a number of startups in Chicago, and is now leading a team of 4 designers. He’s an early adopter, grabbing up the latest technology devices. He commutes into the city by subway, browsing on his phone during the 30 minute ride. He’s interested in photography. He loves trying a new restaurant every night if possible. <br>
						<br>
						<strong>MOTIVATIONS</strong><br>
						Daniel loves to save images he finds online for inspiration. He’s bookmarked hundreds over the course of 3 years. However, the browser can just be slightly frustrating. Creating folders, managing them, etc. It’s sometimes overwhelming and should be easier. He wants to collaborate with others on his team to share what he finds with ease. Subscribes to several software applications, and never can remember passwords. Would love something that combines a few of those. <br>
						<br>
						<strong>FRUSTRATIONS</strong> <br>
						Difficulty managing bookmarks • Too many different softwares • Not accessible on all devices</p>

					<h4>TONI WASHINGTON</h4>
					<p><strong>AGE:</strong> 33 <br>
						<strong>OCCUPATION:</strong> Marketing Manager<br>
						<strong>LOCATION:</strong> Seattle, WA</p>
					<br>
					<q>I can never remember what I bookmarked, so having an easy way to view the stuff I like would be fantastic.</q><br>
					<br>
					<p><strong>BIO</strong><br>
						Susan is married with two kids, residing in the suburbs of Seattle. She is the marketing manager for a large corporation and her team collaborates often with the design and development teams. When she leaves work, Susan doesn’t take her laptop home with her, trying to distinguish the boundary between home and work. However, she oftens finds herself working at night to finish projects. <br>
						<br>
						<strong>MOTIVATIONS</strong><br>
						Susan typically bookmarks content she finds interesting in the browser. However, she often forgets what she’s bookmarked, and keeping track of it can be slightly overwhelming. She primarily uses her laptop at work to gather this type of content, but without it being synced online, she’s unable to access it at home. Susan likes to keep notes for herself and for work, but hasn’t found a tool she enjoys. While she works closely with peers, she rarely shares resources with them.<br>
						<br>
						<strong>FRUSTRATIONS</strong><br>
						Only accessible on work laptop • Hard to remember what’s bookmarked • Other software is difficult to use</p>

					<h4>AMY WURSBERG</h4>
					<p><strong>AGE:</strong> 32 <br>
						<strong>OCCUPATION:</strong> Web Designer<br>
						<strong>LOCATION:</strong> Houston, TX</p>
					<br>
					<q>Right now, my computer can’t take all of the images I’m trying to save. I need a simple way to capture and refer back to this stuff.</q><br>
					<br>
					<p><strong>BIO</strong><br>
						Amy just recently became a web designer. She’s picked up a few freelance jobs and is interviewing with several companies for a fulltime position. She uses her phone to check Facebook and Twitter, and sometimes likes to jot down notes to remind her of things she needs to do. When she’s not chasing her toddler around the house, Amy loves to hit the beach, just an hour south of her. Swimming and running are her passions.<br>
						<br>
						<strong>MOTIVATIONS</strong><br>
						Amy is new to the world of design, and is currently gathering everything possible to help her. Typically, she downloads an image or takes a screenshot, and then she stores these on her computer. She’s used Pinterest before, but not for work. She likes being able to pull up the site anywhere, but organizing the content isn’t the easiest. For notes, she defers to pen and paper. It helps her remember things, but Amy often forgets to take the note pad with her when she leaves the house.<br>
						<br>
						<strong>FRUSTRATIONS</strong><br>
						Older computer has less hard drive space • Doesn’t know what tools to use • Organizing is time consuming</p>

        <h2>USABILITY TESTING</h2>
				<div class="spacing-div-h20px"></div>
				<p>Using <a href="https://www.usertesting.com/">UserTesting</a>, we tested a wireframe of the homepage and mockups of the dashboard. Based on these responses, we made adjustments, such as changing button sizes, and moving the navigation bar and breadcrumb menu. Below are the questions we asked.</p><br>
				<br>
				<br>
				<h4>WIREFRAME - TEST PLAN</h4>
					<br>

					<ol>
						<li>Look around and talk about what you think this is about. What can you do here, what's it for, what strikes you about it?</li>
						<li>Think of something you might want to do here. Try and do that thing.</li>
						<li>What, if anything, do you like or dislike? </li>
						<li>Since this isn’t a finished design, what would you like to see in the final version?</li>
					</ol>
					<br>
					<br>
					<br>
