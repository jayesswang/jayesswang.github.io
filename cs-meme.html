        <h2>ABOUT THIS PROJECT</h2>
        <p> In this project, we were tasked with converting <a href="https://whatdoyoumeme.com/" target="_blank">What Do You Meme?™ (WDYM)</a>, a popular tabletop game for adults, into a mobile game and creating a new product that would engage new and old fans. <br>
          <br>
          The interactive prototype we presented to our stakeholders gave them the ability to try out these features: 1) signup, 2) update their profile, 3) change the music setting, and 4) learn the game through a quick tutorial. </p>

        <h3>PROBLEM &amp; SOLUTION</h3>
        <p> The stakeholders presented us with this question: How would we transform WDYM tabletop game into a mobile game while preserving and incorporating its original game mechanics? It was important to the stakeholders that their users experienced familiarity and a seamless transition in going from one format to the other. <br>
          <br>
          Based on our design research and user tested results, we created a data-driven blueprint for building WDYM mobile game. In general, we were able to stay true to the original tabletop game and also introduced a few new features, such as a timer and a status update window, which allowed us to “translate” certain gameplay experiences into a better fit for the mobile game format. </p>

				<br>
        <p> If you look into some of today’s most popular tabletop games — with classics, such as Monopoly and Clue, or modern favorites, such as Cards Against Humanity, Settlers of Catan, and Ticket to Ride — you would easily find a mobile version of these games. According to research firm, NewZoo, smartphone and tablet game revenues accounted for <a href="https://newzoo.com/insights/articles/the-global-games-market-will-reach-108-9-billion-in-2017-with-mobile-taking-42/" target="_blank">42% of the global games market in 2017</a> and projected trends show steady and continued growth over the next three years. Based on these figures, we have a great opportunity for reaching a wider audience, especially given our close relationship with technology and dependence on our smartphones.</p>

        <p>Using a process that was loosely inspired by the <a href="http://gamestorming.com/6-8-5s/" target="_blank">6-8-5 sketching game</a>, we performed a <a href="https://jayesswang.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/meme-brainstorm-user-stories-20180418.pdf">5-minute brainstorm session</a> for some initial ideas, which helped us to map out and create basic <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZuKIvQFoIKjXd7-PZQzCncpRQuIykCZHn9wNsianbNA/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">user stories</a>, user flows, and a rough draft of the  <a href="https://jayesswang.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/meme-tutorial-script-20180420.pdf" target="_blank">mobile game tutorial script</a>. </p>

				<br>
				For example, where should the card decks go? Where should the avatars be placed? How large or small should we make the profile image? How would player’s differentiate between the judge’s deck or the player’s deck of cards? How would players keep track of the score? How would we prompt the player when it’s his turn to be the judge? <br>
				<br>
				Once we had fleshed out our sketches, we created wireframes based on the ideas that aligned the closest with the stakeholders' goals. <br></p>

        <h3>STYLE GUIDE</h3>
        <p> In order to create a seamless experience going from the tabletop game to the mobile game, it was important that we kept the branding and visual style of WDYM as consistent as possible. We curated a moodboard of popular memes and images from the <a href="https://whatdoyoumeme.com">WDYM website</a>.</p>
        <br>
        <img src="images/cs-meme/meme-moodboard.png" alt=""><br>
        <br>
        <p>For type, we chose Helvetica, which is used in the WDYM Caption Cards, and Impact, which is considered the defacto meme font. For the color palette, we sampled the colors from the WDYM logo, which allowed us to create a cohesive style between the tabletop and mobile versions of WDYM. We also created a <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/dipc3ctv6YzJXVP1idGQ3c82/meme-mobile-game-2018" target="_blank">pattern library of components</a> that we used to build the mobile app, which allowed us to maintain consistency among all elements.</p>

        <h2>USABILITY TESTING</h2>
        <p>We engaged in <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/dipc3ctv6YzJXVP1idGQ3c82/%23cs-meme?node-id=259%3A3773" target="_blank">rapid prototyping and iterated constantly</a> as we built the prototype from wireframes to mockups, testing each design frequently and applying user feedback quickly. <br>
          <br>
          Using Google Hangouts and screen sharing, I followed a <a href="https://jayesswang.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/script-ux-usability-test.pdf" target="_blank">usability test script</a> and remotely observed three users in real-time as they navigated through the prototype and completed a series of assigned tasks. Afterward, I compiled their <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eXM0MqZnDdgo-JbvImlenclDIpIdO4AnQ2Y2DbCTpEU/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">comments and feedback</a> into a Google Doc. <br>
          <br>
          In total, we cycled through roughly four iterations of design and testing before arriving at our final prototype. </p><br>

        <h3>RAPID PROTOTYPING</h3>
        <p>Here are some examples of how the mobile game features evolved through the design, testing, and iteration process: <br>
          <br>
          <strong>BACKGROUND:</strong> We combined some ideas from our moodboard in various ways and sent them through a preference test. Based on users’ responses, we created our final version of the mobile game’s background. [<a href="https://usabilityhub.com/tests/3e1e728dfd83/results/9851f3a5ddad" target="_blank">Background A/B Test</a>] <br>
          <br>
          <strong>BUTTONS:</strong> In the original sketches, we started with a “drag + drop” method for users to draw new cards from the Photo Card or submit their Caption Card. We used a <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/prioritization-matrices/">prioritization matrix</a> to help us determine its benefit and cost. In the end, we decided to use buttons because it brought a higher value to users with less effort by our stakeholders, thus helping to lower production cost. <br>
          <br>
          <strong>CAPTIONS:</strong> We designed the Caption Cards to overlay their caption on the Photo Card for a few reasons. Given that the mobile game format lives in the digital world, we wanted to replicate the experience of creating a meme, exactly as you would in real life. Also, given the wide age demographic of our users and our emphasis on accessibility, we felt that seniors would most likely have more difficulty reading smaller print (of the Caption Cards in the card tray) and would appreciate the caption displayed in a larger font over a Photo Card. <br>
          <br>
          <strong>GAME STATUS:</strong> In any tabletop game, there’s always a person that keeps track of the game status, whose turn it is, and what actions need to happen next. We solved that problem by introducing a status window that easily allows us to update all the players. Initially, we added an input field of emojis to allow players to like or respond to a caption. However, during user testing, we discovered that all 100% of our users disliked this feature, citing that it was confusing or that they probably wouldn’t use it (in its current form). As a result, we removed the feature and tabled its development and refinement for a future release. <br>
          <br>
          <strong>TUTORIAL:</strong> We tested the tutorial script and colored bubbles until we achieved a good balance of brevity and depth that would not bore current fans or confuse new fans. [<a href="https://usabilityhub.com/tests/7d7cff2fb6ec/results/a40b4f71be31" target="_blank">Preference Test #1</a> | <a href="https://usabilityhub.com/tests/f40bc8b797f8/results/779c4f656391" target="_blank">Preference Test #2</a>] <br>
          <br>
          <strong>TIMER:</strong> In Exploding Kittens mobile game, there was a gauge that moved based on a player’s likelihood of drawing the exploding kitten card (players avoided this card at all cost). This feature inspired us to introduce a timer to WDYM mobile game. With a timer, the mobile game created a greater sense of urgency, allowing players to experience the energetic pace of the tabletop game. Without the timer, we noticed that the players and judges took much longer to read and submit their Caption Cards. Once we added a timer, our users commented that they felt less distracted and more engaged in playing WDYM mobile game. Our users differed in their preference of a countdown that ranged from 30- to 90-seconds. We took the average of both extremes and settled on a 60-seconds countdown.</p>
