        <h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
        <p>If you were asked to complete the following analogy, how would you answer?</p><br>
        <blockquote id="analogy">
          <p>Architect is to engineer,<br>
            as web designer is to ________________________.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>If you responded with "web developer" (or anything similar), then you understand that these pairings describe the professional relationship between one who creates a blueprint and one who transforms that blueprint into a tangible final product. </p>
      </div>
      <div class="text-block inspo">
        <h3>ABOUT THIS PROJECT</h3>
        <p>Recently, I discovered a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLNYkxOF6rcIC60856GnLEV5GQXMxc9ByJ" target="_blank">series of YouTube videos</a> by Google Chrome Developers titled, “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLNYkxOF6rcIC60856GnLEV5GQXMxc9ByJ">Designers vs. Developers</a>.” In each episode, the hosts discuss common industry pain points by opening a conversation between the two sides, providing takeaways, solutions to workflows, tools, and discussions on everyday struggles. <br>
				<br>	
				With these insights into the importance and difficulties in the designer/developer relationship, I felt intrigued to study the development process in converting mockups into a functional website. Inspired to level up my ability to empathize and communicate with others, I challenged myself to (literally!) step into a developer's shoes by hand coding a responsive website of my portfolio from scratch and <a href="https://www.github.com/jayesswang" target="_blank">hosting it on GitHub</a>. <br>
				<br>
				I’m always open to growing as a designer, so this project gave me the opportunity to try something new, test out ideas, and expand my range of skills. </p>

        <h3>ABOUT THIS PROJECT</h3>
				<p>I’m always open to growing as a designer, so this project gave me the opportunity to try something new, test out ideas, and expand my range of skills. This article will summarize my discoveries from two seperate tasks:</p>
				<div class="ol-wrapper">
					<ol>
						<li>I challenged myself to (literally!) step into a developer's shoes by hand coding a responsive website of my portfolio from scratch and <a href="https://jayesswang.github.io/">hosting it on GitHub</a>. </li>
						<li>I also explored the power of CSS3 by creating a few different layouts of this project&#8202;&mdash;&#8202;JW Portfolio&#8202;&mdash; with links below under "Select a Design." </li>
					</ol>
				</div>
      </div>
      <div class="text-block select-design">
				<h3>SELECT A DESIGN</h3>
        <ul>
					<li><a href="#">DESIGN 1</a></li>
					<li><a href="#">DESIGN 2</a></li>
					<li><a href="#">DESIGN 3</a></li>
					<li><a href="#">DESIGN 4</a></li>
				</ul>

      <div class="text-block insights-tech">
				<h3>TECHNICAL INSIGHTS</h3>
				<p>Starting with the basics, I studied in-depth how the CSS box model works; essentially, it is a box that wraps around every HTML element and consists of margins, borders, padding, and the actual content. <br>
				<br>
				I enjoyed reading about the history of HTML/CSS and felt incredible relief to discover CSS Grid and Flexbox, which allows developers an unprecedented level of control. I was amazed to learn of the coding acrobatics developers overcame in the past just to create the proper website layout!
				<br>
				<br>
				The HTML below showcases one example of how I applied the box model to create a centered and fixed navigation bar: </p>
				<br>
<pre>
<code>&lt;nav&gt;
  &lt;div class="nav-wrapper"&gt;
    &lt;a href="#"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;menu&gt;
      &lt;a href="#"&gt;HOME&lt;/a&gt;
      &lt;a href="#"&gt;PROJECTS&lt;/a&gt;
      &lt;a href="#"&gt;ABOUT&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/menu&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/nav&gt;
</code>
</pre>
				<p>The CSS below showcases how I styled the HTML:</p><br>
				
<pre>
<code>.nav {
  height: 40px;
  width: 100%;
  position: fixed;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  z-index: 2;
}
.nav-wrapper {
  max-width: 1280px;
  width: 100%;
  background-color: #303030;
  opacity: 0.97;
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
}
</code>
</pre>
				
				<p>If you resize your browser window and scroll down, you'll notice how the navigation bar remains visible and centered. (You get double brownie points if you also observed that the code snippets above are responsive.) <br>
					<br>Although I cannot possibly cover all the topics I studied, as there were just too many, here are some of the major concepts I examined:</p>
				<br>
				<div class="topics-list">
					<ul>
						<li>Semantic HTML</li>
						<li>The value in using CSS grid and flexbox over frameworks, such as Bootstrap</li>
						<li>The hierarchy of the DOM tree</li>
						<li>The order in which a browser parses HTML/CSS and renders content in the browser window</li>
						<li>When to use CSS vs. JavaScript to build interactive features (simple vs. complex)</li>
						<li>How skeleton screens (designing latency stages) improve perceived performance</li>
						<li>The schools of thought between graceful degradation vs. progressive enhancement</li>
						<li>And many more...</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<br>
				<p>As I underwent this learning process, I strengthened my ability to find answers quickly and independently. I also grew in my appreciation for and ability to empathize with a developer’s unique perspective, priorities, and challenges in responsive web development. For example, just the other day, when I read the following excerpt:</p>
				<br>
				<blockquote class="article-quote">
				  <p><span>"In its infancy, [Instagram] was too computationally expensive to allow for both landscape and portrait mode; instead of limiting the interface to one or the other, Instagram’s designers decided to make every photo a square. By being square, you didn’t have to choose anymore. It was a great design decision." </span><br>
					<br>
					~John Maeda, <a href="https://www.wired.com/2017/03/john-maeda-want-survive-design-better-learn-code/">Wired Magazine</a></p>
				</blockquote>
				
				<p>I realized that development-related concerns had become easier for me to understand and anticipate, which translates into a more productive, clear, and expedient collaboration with developers. </p>
			</div>
			<div class="text-block conclusion">
				<h3>CONCLUSION</h3>
				<p>When it comes to balancing the "art" and "science" of UX design, Susan Stuart says it best:</p>
				<br>
				<blockquote class="article-quote">
					<p><span>"A UX Designer must have enough technical knowledge to realistically design for the possibilities and limitations of a platform, and knowledge of some scientific principles of how computer interfaces can affect the brain."</span><br>
					<br>
					~Susan Stuart, <a href="https://blog.prototypr.io/why-creating-a-ux-is-like-writing-often-more-than-art-288efae9523e">Medium</a></p>
				</blockquote>
				
				<p>The more I coded, the more comfortable I became around code. Gone were the days when merely <span>*looking*</span> at an HTML document was enough to overwhelm me. (Well... maybe it still overwhelms me a little!) Interestingly, research shows there are <a href="http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20160811-the-amazing-benefits-of-being-bilingual">numerous benefits in bilingualism</a>, especially in how it improves a person's ability to adapt to change, feel empathy towards others, and creatively solve problems. <br>
				<br>
				I experienced a similar feeling when switching between designing and coding, like a different part of my brain had been activated and a new kind of creativity emerged; the kind where I had the imagination and vision to see alternate approaches and results. (In fact, for my next personal project I just may experiment with CSS and change up the design and layout of my homepage or even learn how to draw with CSS.)<br>
				<br>
				With this kind of insight, my world as a designer has gotten even bigger with new opportunities and greater possibilities. As they say, the sky's the limit.</p>
